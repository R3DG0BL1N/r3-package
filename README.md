# R3 Package

R3 Package aims to be a portable and easy to use set of hacking tools for begginers. 

This repository contains small, easy-to-run scripts and notes aimed at newcomers to
ethical hacking, CTFs and pentesting labs. Use responsibly: the tools are provided
AS-IS and may damage systems if misused. Remember, I'm just a goblin.
