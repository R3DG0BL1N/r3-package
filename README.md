State: **not finished**
*v0.1-alpha*
___
Â¿What is R3 Package? It's a set portable and easy to use ethical hacking tools for begginers. The package also acts as a manual for newcomers, providing useful notes and extensive help with each r3_* script.
___
## Native scripts
- **_lib/r3.py** : R3 standard library. There's no use on executing this script, it must be included on all native scripts. **[ alpha ]**
- **spy/r3_keylogger.py** : Simple keylogger for linux and windows systems. **[ alpha ]**
- **shell/command_web.php**: Very simple piece of code, not even worth calling this part of the r3 package. If you manage to upload this php on a remote server and access it, you can try to execute commands on URL query *"?exec=whoami"*. **[ release ]**
___
## External scripts
- **spy/linpeas.py** : This tool is just incredibly powerfull, sometimes is even too much. Returns every little bit of information one could need of the computer. Check out their git repo for more information. **[ release ]**
- **shell/p0wny_web.php**: PHP web shell, just try it, it's AMAZING. **[ release ]**
- **shell/rev_shell.php**: PHP reverse shell, you need to change hard-coded values for IP and port. **[ release ]**
___
## Work in progress
- **goblin.py** : As you have probably seen, it's empty. **[ NOT WORKING ]**
- **privilege/*** : I forgot I had this folder here lol. I need to do some retuning first, but you are free to explore what these C scripts do. **[ NOT WORKING ]**
